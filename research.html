 </a>
<p> It is well evidenced that public funding of R&D plays a pivotal role in encouraging private-sector innovation. This support acts as a catalyst, boosting the confidence of businesses to invest in new, often high-risk but potentially revolutionary research areas. In this report NCUB estimates that in the UK each £1 of public R&D stimulates between £0.60 to £1.10 of private R&D investment in the short term, and between £3.09 to £4.02 in the long term.

<h4>(with Siepel, Hill and Rowe </a>)</h4>
<p> This study aims to compare the drivers of clustering of rural and urban creative industries in England. We use pre-pandemic web-scraped data from 154,618 creative industry organizations in England, and use a novel technique to identify 71 distinct rural creative “microclusters” of geographically proximate creative firms. We then consider the role of place-based assets and agglomeration in the presence of microclusters at a micro-level geography and find that the determinants of microclustering are generally consistent between rural and urban areas. On that basis we argue that policies to support creative clusters may drive rural regional development.

<p> This report is an integral component of the NCUB Researcher Career Mobility Taskforce’s evidence base. It provides valuable insights into intersectoral mobility in the UK. The report analyses data from diverse sources to understand how mobility varies across career stages, disciplines, technology sectors, and industries. The approach encompasses both macro and micro perspectives, incorporating national and international statistics on intersectoral mobility, as well as micro-level data from research and innovation professionals, businesses, and LinkedIn profiles. These insights deepen the understanding of mobility trends, aiding in the development of a comprehensive evidence framework.

<h4>(Ellams, Dawn, Postlethwaite, Susan, Casadei, Patrizia </a>)</h4>
<p>This paper outlines findings from qualitative research evaluating the benefits
to UK based micro and SME fashion businesses from being co-located within
regional micro-clusters. It looks at the regional activities being undertaken by
fashion firms working within micro-clusters and the challenges they face in the
post Brexit & Covid landscape, as well as specific sustainability challenges.
It finds that regional fashion micro-clusters act as localised networks
developing and providing access to skills and services for businesses based
within them. Recommendations for programme and policy initiatives to
support the development of cluster & cross cluster communities to enable
wider access to these developing UK supply chain networks are suggested.
These include, investment in fashion micro-clusters as innovation hubs as well
as supporting the expansion of businesses operating within them into New
Markets.

<h4>(with Rodriguez </a>)</h4>
<p>The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has been an important source of funding for universities across the UK, enabling partnerships with local business communities and allowing universities to create impact from their research. But this year that funding runs out. This report puts the ERDF under the microscope and explores how universities have used the ERDF to create and maintain research and innovation activities that are driving local growth across the UK. These findings pose important questions about how the UK higher education sector will be impacted by and respond to the loss of ERDF funding.

<p>This short insight paper provides a snapshot of the UK’s graduate entrepreneurs based on insights from the Graduate Outcomes Survey. Graduate entrepreneurs are defined as those that, within 15 months of graduating, either started their own businesses, considered themselves self-employed (freelancers), or are at the conceptual stage (i.e., developing a creative, artistic or professional portfolio). It shows that graduate entrepreneurs in the UK come from different backgrounds and locations. They tend to undertake entrepreneurship activities in the places they have an existing connection to. In other words, the majority of UK graduate entrepreneurs are local entrepreneurs (i.e., they were born and studied locally).</p>

<h4>(with Siepel, Hill, Rowe </a>)</h4>
<p>This research uses pre-pandemic web scraped data of 184,791 creative 
industries organisations in England to identify rural creative microclusters of 
geographically proximate creative firms. Our cluster mapping demonstrates that rural 
microclusters are widely spread across the country, with about one-third of the rural firms 
and organisations in our sample are operating in one of the small clusters. Our results for 
rural clusters are also largely in line with previous findings, which have mainly focused on 
urban settings and the importance of place-based assets (such as cultural institutions and 
social capital), location and diverse economies. We find that the drivers of clustering in 
rural areas are not inherently different from urban areas, apart from a weak link between 
rural microclustering and informal social networks. </p>

<h4>(with Isabel Busom</a>)</h4>
<p>This paper investigates the impact of public support to business investment R&D over the different phases of the business cycle. It uses firm-level data for Spain during the period 2005 to 2014, thus covering an expansion, a recession and a recovery. Propensity score matching and differences in differences methods are combined to estimate the response of supported firms in each phase. Findings show that the profile of beneficiaries of public support did not change significantly over the cycle. Estimated effects depend on the stage of the cycle, the duration of support and the type of outcome indicator. The impact on total investment is positive during expansion years and null during the crisis years; when looking at firms’ allocation of human resources to R&D, the multiplier effect is higher during the crisis years; finally effects last longer for longer spells. Direct support allowed participating firms to allocate more of their employees’ time to R&D activities during the recession. This suggests that under some conditions the multiplier of public support to innovation may be higher during recessions. </p>

<p>We contribute new evidence on the relationship between public support, innovation and productivity at the firm level by investigating several under-explored issues. Using firm-level data for Colombian Companies, we try to identify and compare the profile of firms that have access to public support for innovation in manufacturing and service industries separately. In the second block of research, we examine whether the association between the introduction of innovations and productivity varies across the productivity distribution; third, we distinguish between technological and non-technological innovation, since the latter may be especially relevant in the service industries relative to manufacturing.</p>

<h3><a href="files/Velez_chapter4.pdf" target="_blank">Duration dependence in R&D subsidization and Firm’s innovative behavior <span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></span></a></h3>
<div id="policy-brief-by-the-california-policy-lab" class="section level4">
<p>We investigate the determinants of R&D subsidization persistence and its impact on innovation results. The empirical analysis comprises three reduced-form equations which involve estimating survival rates of R&D subsidies and analyzing their effect on firms’ innovation results including the decision to stop innovation projects. First, we find that firms’ continuous engagement into R&D subsidies is a self-sustained process which is in part fueled by the accumulation of experience in getting funding even once unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for. Second, R&D subsidy persistence is positively correlated with innovation outcomes, including a lower probability of abandoning innovation projects. Results confirm some heterogeneity between SMEs and large firms. In particular, R&D subsidy persistence is associated with New-to-market innovation for SMEs but not for large firms. From the policy perspective, encouraging continuous use of R&D subsidies in SMEs seems to be particularly more appropriate in fostering innovation results which are far from the market (i.e., more radical innovation) and whose degree of market failure may be higher.</p>
